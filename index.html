              AVID's greatest asset was its strong sense of community, so while
              we experimented with some pretty "out-there" ideas for the
              rebrand, the owner, Avi, and I decided on a new logo that kept

              I built AVID’s website with WordPress, using a theme called GoFiz.
              I customized the theme to fit the branding we had created in the
              first step, keeping in mind the themes of community, energy, and
              motivation which were core to the business.
            </p>
            <p>
              AVID uses a software called MindBody which takes care of tracking
              customer information: class enrollments, payment info, etc. I
              customized MindBody’s web widgets to match the brand, and embedded
              them the HTML of the site.

              is the undergraduate game development club at Yale University.
              Before I was project manager as a junior, I started as a
              first-year designing logos and UI elements. Amoriem’s name comes
              from the first game produced by its members. From Amoriem’s
              website:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://amoriem-labs.github.io/about.html">
              The name is an anagram of memoria ("memory" in Latin), and
              includes the words amor ("love" in Spanish) and mori ("to die" in
              Latin).”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              While my design philosophy is usually about emphasizing aesthetics
              and tone over gimmicks and “visual puns”, I decided to go against
              that guideline in creating the symbol used in the logo. In the
              landscape orientation, it resembles the buttons and D-pad of a
              typical gamepad layout. When rotated to the portrait orientation,
              it resembles (albeit abstractly) a skull with a heart on the
              forehead - a nod to the etymology of the group’s name.
            </p>
            <div class="grid two-columns">
              <img
                src="./src/media/amoriem/logo_landscape_icon.png"

            </div>
            <p>
              When choosing the brand colors, I first considered using
              <a
                href="https://yaleidentity.yale.edu/core-identity-elements/yale-colors"
                >Yale’s signature blue</a
              >, but decided against it. Many clubs at Yale use those colors, so
              I figured that in order for our flyers and such to stand out, we
              would need to go a different route. I went with colors that were
              vibrant, exciting, and a bit unconventional to reflect the
              enthusiasm and slight avante-garde bent to the club’s game
              development ethos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since my time with the club, the logo has been updated and
              streamlined - and I have to admit, while the skull imagery has
              been lost, the new logo is a fair bit cleaner and easier to read.
              Nevertheless, I’m happy with the original version, and glad to see
              that its DNA is still there.

              Yale Collections: 18th Century Chinese Gaming Tokens
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the fall of my junior year of college, I took a course called
              Graphic Design Methodologies. One of the larger projects we were
              asked to produce was to produce a set of promotional materials for
              a hypothetical exhibition of something from
              <a href="https://www.yale.edu/collections" target="_blank"
                >the Yale Collections.</a
              >  After some digging, I came across a collection of Chinese
              mother-of-pearl gaming counters from the 18th and 19th centuries.
              If you’re interested in learning about the history of these
              pieces, I highly recommend reading more about it here:
              <a
                href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.gamingcounters"
                target="_blank"
              >
                https://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.gamingcounters
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, I was unsure how I would entice people to come view the
              exhibition. There were many potential angles of attack. I thought,
              for instance, that I might try to create materials that emphasized
              the multi-cultural history of these artifacts, which originated in
              China but mainly used in the West. But considering the wide array
              of materials I was to produce, and thinking about the hypothetical
              audience of these materials (busy college students barely glancing
              at bulletin boards), I decided on a more sensational approach.
              When I had initially visited the
              <a href="https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/" target="_blank"
                >Beinecke Library</a
              >
              to view the collection and take photos, I was interested in the
              unique shapes of many of the tokens, and in the iridescence of the
              mother-of-pearl surface. I decided to see what I could do to
              emphasize these qualities. Iridescence is a hard thing to capture
              in a static photo, since its effect is only noticed when a surface
              is viewed from a variety of angles.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were asked to produce a series of flyers, postcards,
              promotional instagram posts, and finally a mockup of an
              installation to be shown along with the artifacts.

              token would appear.

            <p>
              In high school I started to see a lot of graphic design content on
              social media, and felt inspired to practice some new techniques. I
              wanted to try my hand at creating a wordmark for a logo from
              scratch - that is, by constructing the letters myself rather than
              using a pre-existing typeface. In order to do that, I created a
              grid system and a set of rules that each letter would follow. One
              rule (or guideline, really) was that each letter should have at
              least one segment where its outline extended past the corner.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
              In keeping with the theme suggested by the word ‘grit’, and again
              inspired by trends on social media, I worked with some texture
              assets to get an effect that I thought worked well.

              While helping build some of the underlying data pipelines for a
              business intelligence startup, I decided to take a bit of time to
              create a logo for the company, since we did not have one yet. I
              wanted to match the tone of our pitches to potential clients. Many
              of the clients were mid-size clothing retailers that had been
              using the same business intelligence solutions for many years, so
              we wanted to emphasize that with our solutions, we could provide
              easier access and deeper insights into a company’s accounting and
              sales statistics.

          <h2 class="text-center mb">"Alien Egg" Sculpture</h2>
          <p>
            I built this sculpture for an exhibition of artwork by Yale college
            seniors. I had no prior experience with any of the materials I used
            - I had never made anything with clay, and more technically
            challenging, I had never built a physical circuit before or had any
            experience with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank"
              >Arduinos</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went into the project a bit unsure of what I was going to build,
            but after a few sessions at the pottery studio, and several
            all-nighters at the maker-space on campus, the project started to
            take literal and conceptual shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I ended up making was a small clay vessel, about the size of a
            football, with many holes along the surface. I crammed a bunch of
            LED strips inside, connected via an Arduino circuit to an ultrasonic
            sensor.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img

            <figcaption>The egg sitting in its enclave</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I placed the sculpture on a pedestal, tucked away under the
            staircase in one of the showrooms of the gallery. As members of the
            audience approached the sculpture, the ultrasonic sensor would read
            the distance to the nearest person. This information was fed through
            the circuit such that as people approached the sculpture, the LED
            strips would shine brighter, and as they moved away, the lights
            would dim.
